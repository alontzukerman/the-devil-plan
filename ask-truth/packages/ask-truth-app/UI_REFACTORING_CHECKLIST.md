## üìã Implementation Notes

### Tailwind CSS Best Practices
- Use Tailwind utility classes for all styling
- Leverage theme values through CSS custom properties
- Use component variants for different states
- Maintain responsive design patterns
- Use Tailwind's built-in animations and transitions

### Component Architecture
- Each component gets its own directory with `ComponentName.tsx` and `index.ts`
- Export all components from main UI package index
- Use TypeScript interfaces for all props
- Follow consistent naming conventions
- Include JSDoc comments for complex props

### Testing Strategy
- Test each component in isolation
- Test component integration in screens
- Test responsive behavior
- Test accessibility features
- Test theme switching

## üéØ Quick Start Recommendation

**Start with Phase 1 - Input Component** as it will have the biggest immediate impact:

1. Create the Input component with Tailwind styling
2. Update StartScreen to use the new Input
3. Test the integration
4. Move to Label and FormField components
5. Continue with systematic replacement

This approach ensures you see immediate visual improvements while building a solid foundation for the rest of the refactoring.
