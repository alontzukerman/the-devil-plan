# Ask or Truth: Game Rules

## 1. Game Overview

**Game Name:** Ask or Truth
**Number of Players:** 2
**Goal:** To be the first player to correctly guess the opponent's secret 8-card series.

## 2. Setup

*   **Deck:** Each player uses a standard 52-card deck.
*   **Card Series:** Each player secretly selects 8 cards from their deck to form their series.
*   **Coins:** Each player starts with 10 coins.

### Rules for Creating the 8-Card Series:

1.  **Intra-Suit Ordering:** All cards of the *same suit* within the 8-card series must be arranged in ascending order of their rank (e.g., 2, 5, 10, K of Hearts).
2.  **Inter-Suit Flexibility:** The overall sequence of the 8 cards can have cards of different suits interleaved. The only strict ordering is for cards within the same suit.
    *   *Example:* `7♠, 3♥, 9♠, Q♠, 6♥, K♥` is a valid sequence because Spades (7, 9, Q) and Hearts (3, 6, K) are internally sorted.

## 3. Gameplay

The game proceeds in rounds.

### 3.1. Bidding Phase

1.  **Bidding:** At the start of each round, players have 10 seconds to secretly decide how many coins they want to bid (can be 0).
2.  **Determining the Winner:**
    *   The player who bids more coins wins the right to choose an action ("Ask" or "Truth") for that round.
    *   **Tie:** If both players bid the same amount, neither player wins the right to choose an action for that round. The game proceeds directly to coin updates.

### 3.2. Coin Update

1.  **Bids Deducted:** The amount bid by each player is subtracted from their respective coin totals.
2.  **Coins Added:** Each player receives 2 new coins.
    *   *Example:* A player starts with 10 coins, bids 3. Their new total is (10 - 3) + 2 = 9 coins.
3.  **Low Coin Indicator:** If a player's coin total is 5 or less, this status becomes visible to the opponent.

### 3.3. Action Phase (If there is a bid winner)

The player who won the bid chooses one of the following actions:

#### 3.3.1. Ask

1.  The winning player selects a question from a predefined list (to be detailed later).
2.  The chosen question is asked to the opponent.
3.  The opponent *must* answer the question truthfully.

#### 3.3.2. Truth

1.  The winning player attempts to guess the opponent's complete 8-card series in the correct order.
2.  **Correct Guess:** If the guess is entirely correct, the guessing player wins the game.
3.  **Incorrect Guess:** If the guess is incorrect, the game continues to the next round.
